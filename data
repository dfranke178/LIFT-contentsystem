Because ""the way we've always done it"" PR is not only getting more competitive and expensive, it also doesn't give you a path to an earned audience. 

Your name goes in lights. You say you were in the WSJ or NYT. You toss the logos and the pieces on your site. People rally for you. And then what? 

Dust. 

Content is king and attention is scarce. So a one-and-done piece (which is still critical for credibility and one HELL of a win), or the hope for eyes or clicks on a particular piece should still be part of your strategy, but...

...you need a drip campaign of content that not only guarantees eye balls but also allows you to pick up those viewers as future ""subscribers"" of your content.

Bonus: authentic exec content not only makes your company 90%+ more trustworthy, but it gets nearly 600% more reach than any one else's content.

So you post. Your customers comment. Their networks are filled with lookalike customers. They engage or view your profile. And you say hello, connect with those in your ICP. 

And slowly...you grow and grow and grow your network, your impressions, your inbound, your earned media, your inbound talent, your employee retention due to transparency, your connection with clients, your invites to board seats/conference speaking engagements/industry podcasts, and even better, you set yourself apart if you're connected to buyers in competitive RFP situations (a pro move everyone should run).

The way we used to do it still has a spot, it's just shifted its position in our strategy.

We now need to meet our buyers where they go to read every day.

To me, an exit is for a company you founded or were one of the first, let's say ten, hires of. You built it or wore 17 hats as part of the founding team that grew it. Or you came on as a C-Suite role with one goal in mind: sell. But does it count if you don't meet those metrics? What if you were employee 300 and the company had its exit 18 months later?

What about the X behind a role? If I'm a VP of Sales Engineers and have changed jobs the last three years, is that a 3x? It sure seems to be in LinkedIn land. Does that make me a 5x CEO? 💁😏

HOW we ask for the referrals is the key flip here, and what's often missed in this process. 

Here's how we teach to do it the hashtag#samsales way:

Rep: With the positive feedback you've given us about our work together, would you mind if I took a look at your network on LI and sent you a few names of people to which you're connected to see if you know them well enough to make intros?

Pop open LI Sales Nav
Hit ""Lead Filters"" at the top
Filter to ""Connections Of"" that person + your territory + title/geo/etc.

POOF: a list of people they're connected to + a host of details in each record on how well they may in fact know that person. 

Send them an email with a list of 10-15 that looks like this:

Sam McKenna, CEO @ hashtag#samsales 
James Porter, SVP, Rev Ops @ AT&T

Note: you want to link the name to their LI profile not their LI Sales Nav, and you'll want to include their title to help jog the referrer's memory on who they are as names alone might be useless.

and with this script:

Hi again, Joy!

Here's a list of connections I compiled. I know our networks are sometimes filled with weak ties, so in an effort to make good use of your time, I sent you 15 names and am hopeful you know even 2 or 3 of these well enough to make intros. 

I'm including a quick script below if you'd like to copy/paste, or I can send you a separate email that you can then forward along, if easier.

Thank you again for taking the time out to review these and be of help to me!

Sam

""What's the one thing you'd like to learn today?""
""What prompted you to take this conversation today?""

All three of those will more often than not lead you to answers like:

""We just wanted to see what else was out there""
""Here's a feature/benefit we'd like to resolve...""

Gone is your opp to solve actual pain and instead you excitedly pop into a demo or talking about yourself for 28 minutes.

Think about a first date - would you ever say, ""So...Sam...what's the one thing you'd like to learn about me?"" (insert wiggly eyebrows and a hefty scent of Drakkar Noir). No, you wouldn't, and if you would, hit us up because we can help you with your dating life, too. 💁

Inbound Lead:

Thanks again for making time for us - I could tell you a million things about us (three topic areas you work on with their buyer persona, including what they inbounded for <--easy way to multi-thread and cross sell just by introducing a few more relevant topics), but I'd love to hear about what's on your mind - I know this this and this about your org (<--SMYKM) but tell me about what you're working on and what initiatives you have on your plate for the year ahead, if that's ok?

Outbound Lead:

Thanks again for making time for us - I could tell you a million things about us (rinse/repeat above) and how we typically support CROs in your space, but tell me a bit about what's cooking on your side and how we could make best use out of our time today, if that's ok?

^^they took the call for a reason, and it's not because they're bored. Get to the heart of that in a more human way. 

***********************************************************

The win is if you get the deep sigh and then minutes upon minutes of stream of consciousness that tell you exactly what's top of mind, NOT from a feature/benefit standpoint, but from a business challenge perspective. 

The threads you can pull from there with active listening, open-ended questions, and story-telling will burn your 30 minutes in a highly productive way and likely set you up to double the quantity or double the quality of the attendees for call two, upping your odds that you'll advance the deal.

What strategies do they use to inspire enthusiasm in their employees?

All great companies have similar traits, and their most significant strength is their culture. The ability of their leadership to develop, maintain, and retain their unique culture over the life of the company. It is refreshing to listen and read about companies trying to make their workplace the best and the icing on the cake; increased profit as a result of a great culture. If you are a skeptic, do your research.

Interestingly, money isn't the primary motivator for many employees in these great companies. Their focus isn't solely on profit generation. Instead, they're drawn to the family-like spirit within their organization and a shared purpose that fuels their motivation and inspires them to excel.

But what is emotional intelligence?
And how do you get it?

First, let's clarify what it's not:

• It's not avoiding difficult conversations
• It's not brushing off what others say
• It's not thinking you're always right
• It's not wearing a ""mask"" to work
• It's not reacting without thinking
• It's not caring just about profits
• It's not jumping to conclusions
• It's not ignoring how you feel

Here's what it's really about:

• Knowing yourself well
• Being a calming presence
• Having empathy for others
• Building a culture of respect
• Keeping your emotions in check
• Handling disagreements smoothly
• Making it easy for people to speak up
• Being happy for others when they do well

If you want to be a top performer at work,
work on your Emotional Intelligence.

➟ It makes your team stronger.
➟ It makes work (and life) more satisfying.

LinkedIn just released its
Skills on the Rise 2025 report.

The results are eye-opening.

The data says by 2030, 70% of the skills
used in most jobs will change. 

And of the 15 fastest-growing skills employers want,
10 are soft skills.

Human skills that AI can't replace.

This isn't random. It's a sign of where work is heading.

→ Technical skills gets you in the door
→ Human skills help you lead the room
→ Having both makes you irreplaceable

The top spot? AI Literacy.

But it's not what you might think:

It's not coding AI.
It's not data science.
It's not building models.

It's about knowing how to use AI strategically
to solve problems and make better decisions.

The other top skills show a clear pattern:

→ Adaptability
→ Public Speaking
→ Conflict Mitigation
→ Innovative Thinking

Employers aren't just hiring for technical know-how.

They want people who can:
→ Adapt when plans change
→ Communicate ideas clearly
→ Navigate tough conversations
→ Build strong work relationships
→ Think creatively about challenges

Why this shift?

As work becomes more digital, remote, and AI-driven,
the human element becomes even more valuable.

The skills that will future-proof your career
are the ones only humans have.

The best move you can make right now?

Build one of these soft skills. Then another.

Because they'll still matter long after
today's technical skills become old news.

Shivering. Broken. Six toenails floating in my shoes.

Then Chad Wright said: ""I never get tired.""

Those four words carried me 26 more miles—here’s why they might change your life too 👇

Your mind quits before your body does.

Most people don’t fail because they’re done.

They fail because their mind convinces them they are.

The right words can override that mental quit button.

Chad made me say it.

I resisted. I was exhausted.

But he didn’t let up.

“Say it like you mean it.”

So I did: “I never get tired.”

Something shifted.

At the next aid station, I told a volunteer:

“This might sound crazy, but Chad and I never get tired.”

Mile 75. 80. 90. By 99, I knew we were finishing.

100 miles. Done.

This applies to EVERYTHING.

- In fitness: “I’m built for this.”
- In business: “I figure things out.”
- In life: “I always find a way.”

Your words shape your reality.

Most people talk themselves out of success.

❌ “I’m not ready.”

❌ “I can’t do this.”

❌ “I don’t have enough experience.”

Flip the script:

✔️ “I’m built for this.”

✔️ “I find solutions.”

✔️ “I don’t stop.”

The challenge:

Pick one mantra.

Repeat it when things get tough. Out loud. Until you believe it.

Because when your mind stops fighting you, you’ll go further than you ever thought possible.

I closed the door on my corporate career.

It was something I had been working toward for years

and, it was one of the hardest decisions I’ve made.

I remember setting up the meeting with my manager.

My palms were sweaty at just the thought.

I knew the moment I said,
“I’m putting in my notice”
there would be no turning back.

I wasn’t someone who had these conversations often.
I was loyal - 15 years, 2 companies.
And I had built a brand I was proud of.

Here’s the thing: I actually liked my job.
I worked for one of the top companies in the world.

• 6-month maternity leave
• A 1-month sabbatical after 5 years
• Great stock options and a solid paycheck
• Unlimited PTO (which I unapologetically used)

I wasn’t running from something.
I was running toward something.

A soul-driven mission.

Something that could only unfold if I had the courage 

to take one terrifying step after another

into the vast unknown.

And now, as I approach my one-year anniversary,
my life looks vastly different.

My Summits no longer involve 10K people in Vegas.
↳ They're 50 folks in a room working on a movement.

My “co-workers” aren’t in the hundreds.
↳They’re ChatGPT, my dog, and like-minded women 

My days aren’t filled with fire drills & endless emails.
↳They’re about changing lives, creating content, selling, and serving.

And while my paycheck isn’t what it was before (yet)...

I can say with complete certainty:

I’m on the right path.

Because corporate needs a shift.

Too many women (and men) are hanging by a thread.

Trying to balance ambition and caregiving.

Trying to keep up with a post-pandemic world
that keeps asking for more and giving back less.

So here I am. Out on a mission 

to create the shift we’ve all been craving.

Specifically for the working moms in tech.

Because we need more women in leadership.

And we need those women to be thriving, not surviving through their days.

This shift starts at the individual level.

It starts by reshaping how we define success.

Beyond the paycheck.
Beyond the job title.
Because we are more than either of those. 

We are human.

The shift starts with us.

And I’m honored to be part of the ripple🌀.


Today I help working moms in tech step into their authentic success without sacrifice of their career, their personal life or themselves.

→ Process

For any new task, ask yourself:
- Can I automate it?
- If not, can I delegate it?
- If not, can I make it easier for myself by streamlining it? (Create wiki, checklists, internal docs, etc).

And most importantly, ask yourself:
If a human is currently doing this task (including yourself) - do they have to? Or could AI do it?

→ Rotation

Split your work into 4 types of weeks:
- Build week
- Marketing week
- Ops week
- Slack week

✅ AI-powered.
✅ Lean & small teams.
✅ Automated revenue systems.

Here's my roadmap:

1️⃣ Content creation.
This part can be *entirely* handled by AI.

Tools:
→ GPT-4o fine-tuned models.
→ n8n automation/AI agents.
→ FeedHive for scheduling/publishing.

2️⃣ Blog posts.
This can also be *entirely* handled by AI.

Tools:
→ Perplexity for research.
→ GPT-o3 for writing.
→ Aidbase for including internal knowledge.
→ n8n to orchestrate the workflow.
→ Strapi to update & publish.

3️⃣ Product development.
This can also be *partially* handled by AI.

Tools:
→ Lovable for prototyping.
→ Cline for AI-assisted coding.

4️⃣ Collaboration
This is the human part.
⚠️ AI can *assist* here but should not handle this part.

Tools:
→ GitHub for code management.
→ Plane for project management.
→ Discord for conversations.
→ Miro for flows & charts.

5️⃣ Maintain
You need to keep your knowledge bases updated, your workflows running, and tweak and tune when the AI/automation runs errors (which will happen, it's not flawless).

This is not a future projection.
This IS HAPPENING right now - my own 4-person startup team is one example.

The two most powerful approaches:

1️⃣ AI-powered
Tools like Lovable, Replit, Bolt, and v0 (by Vercel) are taking a full AI-first approach where instructions in human language is the main way to operate the tools and lead development.

✨ Best for tech-savvy non-programmers.

2️⃣ AI-assisted
Extensions like Cline and GitHub Copilot helps speed up product development, but are meant to be used from a coding-first perspective.

I love how easy Cline has made it to switch models and balance cost/speed on the fly.

→ GPT-4o-mini:
A ""junior"" developer. Perfect for doing trivial tasks.

→ GPT-o3:
A ""mid-level"" developer. Perfect for more complex tasks.

→ Sonnet 3.7:
A ""senior"" developer. Most capable AI model for coding right now.

Depending on the task, I'll switch back and forth.

✨ Best for professional software engineers.

What about Cursor and Windsurf?
Honestly - I think they fall short.

- As a tech-savvy non-programmer, these full AI-IDEs are too overwhelming and complex to operate.

- As a professional software engineer, these tools are now too slow, heavy, and too little flexible/customizable to use in a productive way.

Personally, I use the AI-assisted approach the most (Cline + GitHub Copilot). But I see MASSIVE potential in Lovable, Replit and Bolt.

If you're a content creator selling a product or building in public - views/likes are pure vanity.

✅ Instead, zoom in on link-performance.

You probably heard these stories:
→ Creator A: Goes viral and sells next to nothing.
→ Creator B: Crushing sales with 50 likes/post.

If you want to become Creator B, start using traffic/clicks as your one and only north star metric.

Here's how:

1️⃣ Each of your posts should contain a link.
(Or a ""pinned"" comment with a link).

2️⃣ Each link should be unique:
Use a link-tracking tool to collect analytics.

3️⃣ Use AI to analyze results:
ChatGPT does a great job at this.

This is very impressive - the first real-life MCP example that really caught my attention!

How it works:
The MCP server creates a two-way communication between Claude and Blender (using sockets).

This enables you to give Claude instructions - Claude will then push commands to the server, and Blender will immediately receive and execute them in your Blender scene.

And the results are 🔥🔥

The idea of using AI for Blender isn't new. I've been using ChatGPT in the same way for a while.

But it's tedious...

You have to ask ChatGPT what you want...
Then paste the Python code into Blender...
Then tell ChatGPT what happened and what you want different. Then repeat....

This MCP-based workflow is MUCH more efficient.

We can now vibe our 3D scenes.
Can't wait to use this for upcoming YouTube videos.

Why? The odds are in their favour.

Building a startup is tough, but second-time founders bring scars and wisdom that make them exceptional bets for success.

Here’s the data:
▪️ First-time founders: 21% chance of success
▪️ Second-time founders (after success): 30%
▪️ Second-time founders (after failure): 22%
(Harvard Business School, via NfX)

What makes them stand out?
▪️ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺-𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴: They’ve faced fire before—they know what works.
▪️ 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Setbacks don’t derail them; they’ve already bounced back.
▪️ 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸: A web of relationships opens doors that matter.
▪️ 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: They focus relentlessly on what moves the needle.
▪️ 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: They know where to spend their hours—and where not to.

Experience doesn’t guarantee success, but it stacks the deck in their favour.

• People who believe in your vision early especially when the rest of the world denies you. 
• People who open doors. 
• People who bring calm when chaos hits.

(that no one prepares you for)

Growth isn’t easy.

It’s full of doubt, discomfort, and hard decisions.

Struggling doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong.
It means you’re doing the work.

Facing these head-on changes everything:

1. You will doubt yourself - a lot
↳ Accept it as part of the journey and keep moving forward

2. You’ll outgrow some friends
↳ Honour the past, but seek connections that help you grow

3. You’ll discover uncomfortable truths about yourself
↳ Face them with courage and learn from them

4. Your loved ones might not support you
↳ Respect their concern, but stay committed to your growth

5. Your progress will not be linear
↳ Embrace the ups and downs. Look at how far you’ve come

6. Not everyone wants you to succeed
↳ Surround yourself with growth-minded people who lift you up

7. Success doesn’t feel like you imagined
↳ Define success on your own terms and celebrate the small wins

The best version of you is just around the corner.

Trust yourself and keep going.

The best innovations in sports tech tend to:

✅ Draw new participants into the game
✅ Amplify what is great about the game
✅ Help players on the path of continuous improvement

PodPlay Technologies is incredibly excited to extend our partnership with DUPR by integrating DUPR Coach Assigned Ratings. We think this innovation pairs beautifully with DUPR Challenge Matches powered by PodPlay Pro Monitors. 

For the first time, players can move seamlessly through the pickleball journey—from non-rated participants to highly engaged, DUPR-rated players—within one connected system. The pathway includes:

✅ Coach-Assigned DUPR Ratings: Players start their pickleball journey with a DUPR-certified coach, receiving an initial skill assessment and rating to establish their baseline.

✅ Player Development with DUPR Coaches: As players improve, their DUPR Coach provides targeted coaching, tracking progress over time and guiding them toward higher-level play. With ongoing support, players stay motivated and committed to their development.

✅ DUPR Challenge Matches with PodPlay Pro Monitors: Players automatically log matches to DUPR, eliminating all friction to submit results, analyze performance, and challenge others, creating an interactive and data-driven playing experience.

✅ Verified Open Play and Beyond: As players progress, they transition into DUPR-verified open plays, leagues, and tournaments, reinforcing long-term engagement and competition.

We are excited to partner with Gilberto (Tito) Machado and the team at DUPR as well as Rick Geritz, Katie Nimitz and the team at MyJourney Technologies (the Creators of DUPR Coach and DUPR Assigned Ratings).

This is how you lose your best people.
Not because they weren’t loyal.

But because you made their competence a burden.
High performers don’t burn out from hard work.

They burn out from being the safety net: 
- For weak leadership,
- For poor hiring decisions,
 - For problems no one else wants to deal with.

Here’s how to keep your top talent:

✅ Celebrate Their Wins (Loudly)
✅ Give Them Room To Grow
✅ Pay Them Above Market
✅ Invest In Their Growth
✅ Empower Them!

And most importantly—
Stop punishing them for being reliable.

Here’s what NOT to do:

❌ Reward Mediocrity
❌ Enable Toxic Behaviour
❌ Ignore Their Contributions
❌ Make Them Clean Up Mistakes
❌ Dump Extra Work “Because They Can Handle It”

By the time they ask for less… 
They’ve already been given too much.

For years, companies have dominated the hiring process—assessing candidates for ""fit"" while hiding behind polished EVPs and curated testimonials. But here’s the truth: until hiring becomes truly two-way, “candidate experience” often doesn’t live up to the promise.

And when that happens, trust from talent that’s new in the door is broken before they even have a chance to succeed.

💡 What do companies gain when they commit to real transparency?

✔️ Higher retention. People stay when they know what they’re signing up for and feel aligned.
 ✔️ Increased engagement. Employees who feel like they belong don’t just show up—they show up with purpose.
 ✔️ Authentic culture. When people fit, the culture isn’t forced—it’s organic and powerful.
 ✔️ A reputation that attracts top talent. The best candidates seek out companies that don’t just talk about great culture—they prove it.

If your company actually walks the talk, now’s the time to show it.

The ones hiding behind outdated narratives? People are going to see right through it—real soon.

Hiring is changing. It's about time.
