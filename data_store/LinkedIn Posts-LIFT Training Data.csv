1,"Hiring is hard. Really hard.

Typically sales interviews focus on the wrong things:

- What's your closing percentage?
- How much revenue did you generate? 
- Tell me about your sales process.

It's ironic how many candidates out there have hit Presidents Club, thrive in ambiguity, have a 75% close rate, were a top 3 performer out of 200 for three years in a row, love getting feedback from their manager, and YET they struggle to provide detailed examples when asked tough questions. 

To identify true top talent you have to dig deeper:

✅ Coach-ability and a growth mindset 
✅ Resilience and strong emotional intelligence 
✅ Alignment with your company values

Also, make them role play! We're in sales!

2,"This past weekend I ran the Go! St. Louis race. This was my second half-marathon, and it was such a blast running alongside my wife Monica Franke for the first time. A few hydration tablets + stretching sessions, and now I've got the itch for what's next 😬 

I've always enjoyed running - but the planning that goes into racing is slowly become a staple in my fitness journey. Preparation, nutrition, dedication, and consistency are all SO necessary in the leading months before race day. Pushing to keep these traits at the forefront of my mind physically has also proven to significantly help me professionally. Who knew 🤷‍♂️

3,"It's easy to say ""control the controllables"" until you're the one who has to put that into action. ACTION being the key word. So many times throughout my career, including this week, I've allowed myself to be trapped by inaction or get caught up in aspects of my work that I cannot control. 

This is exhausting - but more importantly keeps you stuck in the ""merry-go-round of ineffectiveness"" as I like to call it. Take it from my daughter - you can only lay face first on the floor for so long before you finally realize that you have to get up and get moving!

4,"Sales organizations with a structured onboarding process experience 50% greater new-hire productivity. 

Sounds obvious, but it's quite true. 

Here's LIFT Leadership Group's simple 30-day framework for ramping up sales talent quickly:

✅ Create a Structured Onboarding Plan
• Provide a clear roadmap with defined expectations and milestone goals
• Ensure there's a systematic knowledge transfer (product info, etc)
• Facilitate intro's to peers and stakeholders who will support their success

✅ Schedule Regular Coaching Conversations
• Implement role-playing exercises to build confidence in sales pitches
• Conduct joint client calls with detailed debriefs afterward
• Dedicate 3-4 hours weekly for direct coaching

✅ Facilitate Early Wins for Lasting Confidence
• Provide warm leads to new hires to build initial momentum
• Pair them with senior teammates on promising deals
• Identify existing customers ready for upsells to create quick wins

The first month sets the foundation for long-term sales performance. By investing in a structured onboarding process now, you're not just accelerating productivity—you're building the confidence and competence that drive sustainable results.

5,"8 weeks into building a business one tool has stood out amongst the rest. 

Notion is epic. 

I'm such an advocate whether it be for personal or professional use. You can do practically anything in there - build dashboards, map out project plans, create job descriptions, embed decks and agreements, etc. It's been amazing, and so helpful at keeping my thoughts (somewhat 🤪) organized. 

In a client milestone meeting last week the C-suite team said that ""our organization and communication has been exceptional"". We've used Notion workspaces for target client proposals and as our project management tool. Couldn't recommend it enough!

6,"This morning I built myself an action plan 📝

Nothing fancy - 30 day plan on how to become a more effective writer. A skill that I rarely have had to flex throughout the years until recently. Each day of the plan involves focused research on specific topics, contemplating different perspectives, reflecting on my own POV, and then taking actionable steps to improve. 

It should require less than 20 minutes of my time each day, a commitment I'm making for the next month with specific goals in mind to achieve by June 10th. I can't tell you how good this feels vs death staring at my keyboard for the past three weeks hoping it will ""just come to me"" 😵‍💫

7,"Treat yo self! (shoutout Donna and Tom)

The rollercoaster of emotions that comes with sales can include stress, major anxiety, excitement, complete and total despair, quickly followed by the ultimate feeling of satisfaction that is the win. 

Sometimes, all within 24 hours. That's been me this week 🙋🏻‍♂️

Somewhere in there is also unnecessarily playing out 10 highly unlikely scenarios that you're convinced will happen (hence total despair). 

*Insert* - treat yo self! Celebrate the wins, reflect on the losses, but take time for YOU to reset and refocus. This is not the norm, but the most successful sales reps I know have a system for it.

8,"In my first sales job I ever had I signed 0 clients. 

Summer of 09. I was hired to do door-to-door AT&T sales. I would go on this long rant of how you don't truly know sales unless you have done d2d, but I didn't make a sale so I'm not sure that counts as ""doing d2d"" 😂

It was a scorching hot summer, and I spent it knocking on doors asking people ""if they have 5 minutes"". I could write quite the humorous blog on my top 10 favorite interactions, but to sum it up people weren't thrilled to see me. 

It was brutal. I had NO IDEA what I was getting into. I hadn't researched conversion rates, read through top talk tracks, rode along with a top performer - you name it. Anything marginally helpful in setting yourself up to succeed I had not done. 

So I failed. I quit. 

Which crushed my ego, but was a launching pad for an incredibly valuable lesson. 

Hope is not a strategy. 

I walked into that job hoping that I would figure it out. Not all companies will provide you with the perfect onboarding plan. At the end of the day it's on YOU to set yourself up to win, take advantage of your resources, and ask for help along the way.

9,"Mercury Spheres was such an incredibly inspiring and thought provoking conference this week. 

The schedule, environment, and content showed how intentional they were in their planning and execution. All around I would highly recommend it for any early stage founder!

It's so easy to leave these conferences on a high, and filled with countless notes to take back to your office......that will quickly be forgotten and buried underneath a backlogged inbox, client needs, and too many meetings. 

Instead of listing each of the illustrious speakers and their insights I'm choosing to share the three things that I'll be putting into action starting next week. 

1. 𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗵𝘆. Be narrow and focused on solving one specific problem in the marketplace, do it better than anyone else, and then repeat. Build a new rough draft by 6/6.

2. 𝗕𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗮𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂. Every marketing touchpoint must be in clear alignment, and capture attention. Update website, LI page, and one-pagers to a unified message by 6/30.

3. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝘂𝗰𝗵. Build out a vision of how you plan to use AI to drive your internal and external operations. Map out V1 by 7/15. 

Time IRL these days can feel so empowering in the moment. Don't let those opportunities only be events! Soak it all in, build 2-3 primary takeaways, and commit to the progress!

10,"""If we hire 3 AE's it's safe to assume at least 1 of them won't work out, right?""

This was a client I spoke with this week. 

They're investing in their sales team, and pushing to hit an aggressive ARR target by EOY. 

""As long as we're at least a 3/5 on them shouldn't we pull the trigger?""

Absolutely....... NOT. Too often it's become acceptable to offer the ""leaning hire"" or ""decent fit"" candidate out of necessity. We're almost mid way through 2025, it'll take 6-8 weeks to ramp, productivity won't show up on the dashboard until late Q3, etc etc. 

Here are the important❓'s:

→ How much will the wrong hire cost (⏱️ & 💰) if they quit 3 months in?
→ How much will it cost if they don't perform, and they stay?
→ How will a negative culture add impact the rest of the team?

Hiring will NEVER be perfect. I've made plenty of poor hires over the years, 𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒔𝒕 𝒐𝒏𝒆𝒔 𝒘𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝑰 𝒔𝒂𝒘 𝒂 𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒇𝒍𝒂𝒈 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒊𝒈𝒏𝒐𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒊𝒕. 

Build core competencies, ask clear Q's to measure against those competencies, and hold a high talent bar (𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑏𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑚). 

I'd take 2 (or even 1) exceptional rep dying to learn > an additional producer that could present serious risk to my year-end goal or worse, my culture.
