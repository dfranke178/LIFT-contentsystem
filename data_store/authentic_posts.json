Really hard.\n\nTypically sales interviews focus on the wrong things:\n\n- What's your closing percentage?\n- How much revenue did you generate? \n- Tell me about your sales process.\n\nIt's ironic how many candidates out there have hit Presidents Club, thrive in ambiguity, have a 75% close rate, were a top 3 performer out of 200 for three years in a row, love getting feedback from their manager, and YET they struggle to provide detailed examples when asked tough questions. \n\nTo identify true top talent you have to dig deeper:\n\n✅ Coach-ability and a growth mindset \n✅ Resilience and strong emotional intelligence \n✅ Alignment with your company values\n\nAlso, make them role play!

A few hydration tablets + stretching sessions, and now I've got the itch for what's next 😬 \n\nI've always enjoyed running - but the planning that goes into racing is slowly become a staple in my fitness journey. Preparation, nutrition, dedication, and consistency are all SO necessary in the leading months before race day. Pushing to keep these traits at the forefront of my mind physically has also proven to significantly help me professionally. Who knew 🤷‍♂️ \n\nIf anyone has race recommendations coming up in the next few months let me know!",

I quit. \n\nWhich crushed my ego, but was a launching pad for an incredibly valuable lesson. \n\nHope is not a strategy. \n\nI walked into that job hoping that I would figure it out.

NOT. Too often it's become acceptable to offer the \"leaning hire\" or \"decent fit\" candidate out of necessity. We're almost mid way through 2025, it'll take 6-8 weeks to ramp, productivity won't show up on the dashboard until late Q3, etc etc. \n\nHere are the important❓'s:\n\n→ How much will the wrong hire cost (⏱️ & 💰) if they quit 3 months in?\n→ How much will it cost if they don't perform, and they stay?\n→ How will a negative culture add impact the rest of the team?\n\nHiring will NEVER be perfect. I've made plenty of poor hires over the years, 𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒔𝒕 𝒐𝒏𝒆𝒔 𝒘𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝑰 𝒔𝒂𝒘 𝒂 𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒇𝒍𝒂𝒈 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒊𝒈𝒏𝒐𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒊𝒕. \n\nBuild core competencies, ask clear Q's to measure against those competencies, and hold a high talent bar (𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑏𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑚). \n\nI'd take 2 (or even 1) exceptional rep dying to learn > an additional producer that could present serious risk to my year-end goal or worse, my culture. \n\n Who agrees, or disagrees?? 🤔",
