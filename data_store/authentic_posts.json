NOT. Too often it's become acceptable to offer the \"leaning hire\" or \"decent fit\" candidate out of necessity. We're almost mid way through 2025, it'll take 6-8 weeks to ramp, productivity won't show up on the dashboard until late Q3, etc etc. \n\nHere are the important‚ùì's:\n\n‚Üí How much will the wrong hire cost (‚è±Ô∏è & üí∞) if they quit 3 months in?\n‚Üí How much will it cost if they don't perform, and they stay?\n‚Üí How will a negative culture add impact the rest of the team?\n\nHiring will NEVER be perfect. I've made plenty of poor hires over the years, ùíÉùíñùíï ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíòùíêùíìùíîùíï ùíêùíèùíÜùíî ùíòùíÜùíìùíÜ ùíòùíâùíÜùíè ùë∞ ùíîùíÇùíò ùíÇ ùíìùíÜùíÖ ùíáùíçùíÇùíà ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùíäùíàùíèùíêùíìùíÜùíÖ ùíäùíï. \n\nBuild core competencies, ask clear Q's to measure against those competencies, and hold a high talent bar (ùëíùë†ùëùùëíùëêùëñùëéùëôùëôùë¶ ùë§‚Ñéùëíùëõ ùëèùë¢ùëñùëôùëëùëñùëõùëî ùëé ùëõùëíùë§ ùë°ùëíùëéùëö). \n\nI'd take 2 (or even 1) exceptional rep dying to learn > an additional producer that could present serious risk to my year-end goal or worse, my culture. \n\n Who agrees, or disagrees?? ü§î",
